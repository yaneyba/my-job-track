# Waitlist Modal Logic Test

## Current Implementation Status ✅

### 1. `triggerWaitlistCTA` Function
- **Location**: `src/contexts/DemoContext.tsx`
- **Logic**: Only shows modal if:
  - User is in demo mode AND
  - User is NOT already waitlisted (checks both user session and waitlist emails)

### 2. Modal Triggers
- **Only trigger**: QR Scanner when in demo mode
- **No other components** directly trigger the modal

### 3. Test Scenarios

#### Scenario A: Pure Demo Mode
- User enters demo mode 
- Has NOT signed up for waitlist
- QR scan → **Should show waitlist modal** ✅

#### Scenario B: Demo Mode - Already Waitlisted
- User enters demo mode
- Has already signed up for waitlist
- QR scan → **Should NOT show waitlist modal** ✅

#### Scenario C: Waitlist Test Mode
- User signed up for waitlist and is in test mode
- Should have full local storage functionality
- QR scanner should be disabled for waitlisted users

#### Scenario D: Regular User Mode
- Authenticated user
- Full functionality
- No waitlist modal triggers

## Key Files Updated
1. `src/contexts/DemoContext.tsx` - Fixed waitlist modal logic
2. `src/components/QR/QRScanner.tsx` - Only place that calls triggerWaitlistCTA
3. `src/data/providers/LocalStorageDataProvider.ts` - Waitlist test mode data persistence
4. `src/components/Landing/WaitlistSignup.tsx` - Signup form
5. `src/components/UI/WaitlistTestBanner.tsx` - Test mode indicator

## Expected Behavior
- **Demo users who haven't joined waitlist**: See modal on QR scan attempts
- **Demo users who have joined waitlist**: No modal, seamless experience  
- **Waitlisted users**: Full test mode with local storage persistence
- **Regular users**: Full authenticated experience

✅ **Implementation Complete and Correct**
